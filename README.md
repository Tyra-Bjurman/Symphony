# Symphony
A strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> webapplication server.

This is a code-necromancy project for fun and nostalgia. I proudly wrote the original source cirka 2015. Sadly almost all was lost to cyberspace a long time ago.

The server features:
* Erlang/OTP Server architecture
* Hot-swappable view and controller modules
* Erlang modular controllers
* View templating language plugins
