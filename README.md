Strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> webapplication server

This is a relaunch of a projekt from 2009, may recode the server for fun if I feel like it.

The server featured:
* Erlang/OTP Server architecture
* Hot-swappable View and Controller modules
* View template language as plugins
